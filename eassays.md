1. As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of human to think for themselves will surely deteriorate
```
Thesis:
The advancement of technology and the reliance on new inventions do not preclude people from critical thinking or creativity.

Draft
1. Pros
a. Advancement of technology has made our daily life much more convenient and productive. Instead of a bane for human capacity, in most cases, the intricate machinery in our daily life is a boon for our creativity. EG. Imagine it is 300 years ago -- long before the invention of modern transportation technology -- and you want to take a well-deserved break.
b. The reliance on highly efficient machinery extricated people from a plethora mundane drudgeries. As a result, we are freed from quotidian busy work and can invest more energy and time doing truly creative work. EG. Conspicuous examples can be found in the field of physics
2. Cons
a. some people do become lazy and too dependent upon modern technology.

2. To understand the most important characteristics of a society one must study major cities

```
While understanding the characteristics of any society is an exacting endeavor, through studying major cities of the targeted society, one can often gain a firm grasp of its most signal features.
Pros
1. Major cities often have the largest population. A society, though ostensibly an abstract concept, is nothing more than a collection of people. Naturally, a disquisition of a society is intrinsically a study about the people who constitute it. As a result, one can reveal the idiosyncrasies of a society by researching its most populated metropolises. EG. the changes in daily life for citizens of Shanghai is an epitome of what happened to Chinese society as a whole in the past 50 years.
2. Major cities are also centers for the economy, academics and entertainment. Naturally understanding the intellectual output from those centers is key to understanding a society.
3.
Cons
Admittedly, it is too optimistic claim that through merely studying a given nation's metropolises can paint a full picture of the given society.

Conclusion

* 3.Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed
```
Thesis

Cons
1. it is all but impossible to judge whether one can succeed in the future career merely based on his or her coursework. EG. Hawking
2. more fundamentally, the definition of success is diverse and can not -- also should not -- be defined a group of authorities. EG. Maoist China
Pros
However, this is not to say educators can not offer constructive advices for students in terms of career planning. On the contrary,

4. scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could
```
pros.
1. scandals cause riveted attention on a particular issue. compare to speaker. EG. 三路奶粉
2. scandals brings the sense of urgency
compare to speaker. EG.滴滴打车

Cons.
Scandals by definition means something went awry

5. Claim: governments must ensure that their major cities receive the financial support they need in order to thrive
Reason: it is primarily in cities that a nation's cultural traditions are preserved and generated
```
cons.
1. In most countries, Cultural traditions are preserved and in non-urban areas. Eg. China 非物质遗产
2. Even in societies where it makes sense to prioritize on supporting larger cities since ....
, it is a cursory decision to.... since large cities are much more likely to be self-sufficient.

Pros
1. in certain societies, supporting major cities financially are justified
However, even in those cases, major cities can be easily self-sufficient

## Behavior
* 78. People's attitudes are determined more by their immediate situation or surroundings than by society as a whole
```
Thesis: it's determined more by surroundings and immediate situations
Surrounding:
1. While we live in a society that often imposes a dominant point of view, we spend most of our time interacting with our friends, family and loved ones. We live our daily life not worrying about what is the . Indeed, It is our surroundings that shaped our point of view, carved out our personality and predominantly determined our attitudes. []EG, how Obama's mother and where he grew up gave him strength.. “It can not just be the bloodline that defines us fully. Live your life to the full extent and let your experience shape your dreams.”... It is for this reason, there are diversities of ideology

2. Moreover, immediate situation also, combined with surroundings also shape people's attitudes. One can observe this in US's attitudes towards immigration. EG used to be open

Society as a whole:
there is no doubt, in modern society.
While we are easily incensed by incendiary taking points presented by cable TV. People who are around us impose a much long-standing impact shaping our world view and attitudes.
```
* 38. It is primarily through our identification with social groups that we define ourselves
  ```
  Agree
  Pro
we are born into a social unit called family where we grew up under the influence of our parents. From the earliest stage of our life, we learn to gauge our behaviors based on our interaction with this specific social unit. During this process, we start to develop our identity by following our parents' judgement or sometimes rebel against it.  When we are old enough go to school, our identities are then subject to influence from a broader spectrum of social groups -- our classmates, our teachers and the school as a whole. We continue to develop our identity via constantly being judged by numerous standards imposed by different social groups. Someone might be the popular kid .......
  During this process, we also become friends with people who share the same value...........accentuate our identity. Also

Eventually, we manage to graduate from school and find a job to be independent. We are immediately immersed in new social groups such as a company, a government unit or a non-profit orgnization. We learn to adjust..... Literally from born to death, we form, develope and reshape our indentity against some standards defined by some social constructs. It is sufficient to conclude that............

Con

Admittedly, one might quick to conclude the ostensible danger to identify ourselves fully through the lense of groups. What about our individuality? Isn't it ......... as any mordern day well-educated liberal might argue. I would say, the commonplace definition of individuality is a misleading one. For nobody lives in a , we fabricate our identity via piecing together our experience gained from interacting with different people and group. We are still unique in the sense that our idiosyncracy is achieved by segmenting with different social groups uniquely. In this convoluted fashion,  the individuality is not lost after all. As Carl Sagan elegantly put, "We are all start dust, but the different arrangement of atoms guaranteed each of us's ingenuity"

* 82/97/100/124. Colleges should require students to spend at least a semester studying.
```
Thesis
Should not
Pro
1. Against, study abroad is not for everyone. Lots of people are not able to adapt to a completely new environment. This problem is less obvious today since currently people who choose.....This self-selective process have guaranteed that people who went stduy abroad are more often than not who are suitable mentally. Studying abroad might also not be suitable or counter-productive for students who are interested in fields that US already lead......
2. Moreoever, once enunciated as a policy. It is likely to add extra burden to students financially..............
Against
3. Admitedly, no one is refuting..........disguised replacement of concept. The problematic part is to enforce it as a requirement. Campuses should encourage people to study abroad and offer ample opportunities to do so. However, by requiring students to do that, it is likely to bring ......

* 77. The most effective way to understand contemporary culture is to analyze the trends of its youth
```
Thesis
By only analyzying, people can not arrive at a comprehensive understanding of the contemporary culture.
First, the society is formed by people at different age groups. Since the youth are often the most vocal about their like and dislikes, we are quick conclude . Eg, Esports popular amongst the youth but not necessarily incorporated into mainstream contemporary culture yet. Another example is how long
Secondly, contemporary culture, more often than not, is actually shaped by people who can exert actual impact on society as a whole. EG. legalization of marijuana
Moreover, the contemporary culture is also shaped by the pertinent culture's traditions . EG. Chinese   . Everlasting values

Admittedly, youth often reflect what is trendy in a certain society. It is no way the most effective to  the disquisition about the contemporary culture of a society will most likely render facetious and hackneyed.

## Education

40/47/90. Educators should find out what students want included in the curriculum and then offer it to them.
(Reason: students are most motivated to learn when they are interesting in what they are studying)

```
No
Pro
(1. Students may not know what their real passions are due to the lack of knowledge. EG. Hawkins was more interested in history)
(2. It is important to step out your comfort zone and learn things you are not ostensibly interested in or even dislike. Eg. what i learned from history)
3. the process become very convoluted
Against
(students learn most effectively when they are engaged and motivated)......open to feedback instead commending the development of curriculum to students' hand
