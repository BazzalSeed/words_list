## Behavior
* 78. People's attitudes are determined more by their immediate situation or surroundings than by society as a whole
```
Thesis: it's determined more by surroundings and immediate situations
Surrounding:
1. While we live in a society that often imposes a dominant point of view, we spend most of our time interacting with our friends, family and loved ones. We live our daily life not worrying about what is the . Indeed, It is our surroundings that shaped our point of view, carved out our personality and predominantly determined our attitudes. []EG, how Obama's mother and where he grew up gave him strength.. “It can not just be the bloodline that defines us fully. Live your life to the full extent and let your experience shape your dreams.”... It is for this reason, there are diversities of ideology

2. Moreover, immediate situation also, combined with surroundings also shape people's attitudes. One can observe this in US's attitudes towards immigration. EG used to be open

Society as a whole:
there is no doubt, in modern society.
While we are easily incensed by incendiary taking points presented by cable TV. People who are around us impose a much long-standing impact shaping our world view and attitudes.
```
* 38. It is primarily through our identification with social groups that we define ourselves
  ```
  Agree
  Pro
we are born into a social unit called family where we grew up under the influence of our parents. From the earliest stage of our life, we learn to gauge our behaviors based on our interaction with this specific social unit. During this process, we start to develop our identity by following our parents' judgement or sometimes rebel against it.  When we are old enough go to school, our identities are then subject to influence from a broader spectrum of social groups -- our classmates, our teachers and the school as a whole. We continue to develop our identity via constantly being judged by numerous standards imposed by different social groups. Someone might be the popular kid .......
  During this process, we also become friends with people who share the same value...........accentuate our identity. Also

Eventually, we manage to graduate from school and find a job to be independent. We are immediately immersed in new social groups such as a company, a government unit or a non-profit organization. We learn to adjust..... Literally from born to death, we form, develope and reshape our identity against some standards defined by some social constructs. It is sufficient to conclude that............

Con

Admittedly, one might quick to conclude the ostensible danger to identify ourselves fully through the lense of groups. What about our individuality? Isn't it ......... as any modern day well-educated liberal might argue. I would say, the commonplace definition of individuality is a misleading one. For nobody lives in a , we fabricate our identity via piecing together our experience gained from interacting with different people and group. We are still unique in the sense that our idiosyncracy is achieved by segmenting with different social groups uniquely. In this convoluted fashion,  the individuality is not lost after all. As Carl Sagan elegantly put, "We are all start dust, but the different arrangement of atoms guaranteed each of us's ingenuity"

  ```
* 82/97/100/124. Colleges should require students to spend at least a semester studying abroad.
```
Thesis
Should not
Pro
1. Against, study abroad is not for everyone. Lots of people are not able to adapt to a completely new environment. This problem is less obvious today since currently people who choose.....This self-selective process have guaranteed that people who went study abroad are more often than not who are suitable mentally. Studying abroad might also not be suitable or counter-productive for students who are interested in fields that US already lead......
2. Moreover, once enunciated as a policy. It is likely to add extra burden to students financially..............
Against
3. Admittedly, no one is refuting..........disguised replacement of concept. The problematic part is to enforce it as a requirement. Campuses should encourage people to study abroad and offer ample opportunities to do so. However, by requiring students to do that, it is likely to bring ......
In conclusion
```
* 77. The most effective way to understand contemporary culture is to analyze the trends of its youth
```
Thesis
By only analyzying, people can not arrive at a comprehensive understanding of the contemporary culture.
First, the society is formed by people at different age groups. Since the youth are often the most vocal about their like and dislikes, we are quick conclude . Eg, Esports popular amongst the youth but not necessarily incorporated into mainstream contemporary culture yet. Another example is how long
Secondly, contemporary culture, more often than not, is actually shaped by people who can exert actual impact on society as a whole. EG. legalization of marijuana
Moreover, the contemporary culture is also shaped by the pertinent culture's traditions . EG. Chinese   . Everlasting values

Admittedly, youth often reflect what is trendy in a certain society. It is no way the most effective to  the disquisition about the contemporary culture of a society will most likely render facetious and hackneyed.

```

## Education

40/47/90. Educators should find out what students want included in the curriculum and then offer it to them.
(Reason: students are most motivated to learn when they are interesting in what they are studying)

```
No
Pro
(1. Students may not know what their real passions are due to the lack of knowledge. EG. Hawkins was more interested in history)
(2. It is important to step out your comfort zone and learn things you are not ostensibly interested in or even dislike. Eg. what i learned from history)
3. the process become very convoluted
Against
(students learn most effectively when they are engaged and motivated)......open to feedback instead commending the development of curriculum to students' hand
```
37. Society should identify those children have special talents and provide training for them at an early age to develop their talents

no.
Pro.

1. **Exhorting young children to undergo special training that is narrowly focused on certain fields can have detrimental effect on their all-around development**. Often times, those children with amazing talents start to demonstrate their amazing aptitudes in a certain field at very young age. Their talents are so prodigious and glamorous, we often forget that they, though appear to be precocious, are still callow children. They need to undergo the same process within a community of similar age children to develop social skills that are not pertinent to a specific field but equally important in life. By skipping this process and rush them into a special program, we are depriving them the opportunity to become a loving, cordial and well-rounded human being. EG Mozart, if given more time to mature..
  ```
  If you equate Mozart’s personality with the perfection and stunning beauty of his compositions, or with the personality represented in the play and movie “Amadeus,” you will either be totally enlightened or totally depressed by the facts contained within this book: “Mozart” by Wolfgang Hildesheimer <Mozart: Wolfgang Hildesheimer, Marion Faber: 9780374522988: Amazon.com: Books>. This biography presents a fairly in-depth analysis of the man as a person (a quite enigmatic personality) and as an unparalleled musical genius. Note: Several reviewers diss the book because it apparently didn’t confirm their preconceived “romantic” notions of the man. It should be noted also that notions are entertained in the mind and that facts bear the truth.

```
dirty jokes and terrible with money
2. Offering special training to prodigies as a society is also quixotic. Who are responsible to evaluate children with talents? By distributing more educational resources to special group of children, will normal children suffer from a paucity of resource?

Against
Admittedly, this is well-intentioned proposition. go back to mozart's example again

__17/68. Formal education restrain our spirits and minds rather than set them free__
Agree
Pro

1. The freedom of spirits and minds is hinged upon individuality. To be truly free, one has to have the latitude to develop his or her own idiosyncrasy. Formal education be definition is designed to conform a large group of students to a few set of standards.

2. Moreover, formal eduction tends to instill a sense of structure into students' mind. This is antithetical to set students free.  This is why, people who bring revolutionary changes to our society are often formal eduction drop outs. EG. steve jobs, Bill Gates. Being free is the sinew of creativity
  seminal inventions

All this is not to say formal education is without its merits.......more and more schools are adopting a more reformed curriculum. Eg. China, US

6/14/96/116. A nation should require all of its students the same national curriculum until college
NO
PRO
1. The contention to impose a single set of curriculum on all students across nation until college can be quixotic for countries where more multifarious ethnic groups exist. Often times minority groups are eager to maintain their own cultural tradition and impart the young with knowledge pertinent to their convention. .......... Eg. China , Tibet
2. Conforming all people to the same curriculum also runs the risk of depriving students' chances to explore different fields and cultivate their own idiosyncrasies........ one may say, do that until college

Admittedly, this suggestion might be with good intention...
quixotry

__81/95. All parents should be required to volunteer  time to their children's schools.__
Agree

Pro
1. Beneficial for parents in various ways. Learn more about schools. build a  community of parents (great resource). Lastly, this volunteering for school also epitomize being a decorous and contributing citizen.
2. On the other hand, schools are also likely benefit from parents' volunteering.

Against
This should implement with lots of discretion. parents struggling financially. kids lost their parents.


__58. Learning is primarily a matter of self-discipline; students cannot be motivated by school or college__
Thesis. While it is true that learning is hinged cardinally upon one's self-discipline, it is farfetched to conclude that students cannot be motivated by school.

Pro.
1. no one is born with amazing self-discipline. Even a prodigy that is dying to learn...... On the contrary, an exemplary self-discipline is always adventitious and cultivated by one's surroundings. School is often the place we develop our discipline to become successful.

2. School or college also offers us a community to help us stay motivated. a. Through, beneficial and friendly competition b. through a community where people are chasing dreams in pertinent fields.
Against.
3. Admittedly, self-discipline is the key for acquiring any in-depth knowledge.

__15/32/35/98/129/136/137/140. Educational institutions should actively encourage their students to choose fields of study that will prepare them for lucrative careers__
Disagree
Pro
1. it is all but a quixotic project for schools to anticipate what occupations are lucrative upon students' graduation. Eg, accountant
2. What's lucrative might not be what students are passionate about EG. Beethoven.if convinced to become a computer scientist
Against
Admittedly, school should take future employment in consideration. It is unfortunate to see lots of college students fail to find a job after graduation.


__20/39. Some people believe that college students should consider only their own talents and interests when choosing a field on availability of jobs in that field.__
Should base on talents and interest
1.it is quixotic for people to anticipate what occupations are in high demand upon graduation. Eg, accountant
2. can only achieve your greatest potential if you are fully engaged in your field of study and passionate about what you are learning. At a individual level............ From society's standpoint........
Against.
Admittedly, employment opportunities should be taken into consideration upon choosing a major.
__73.College and universities should require the faculty to spend time working outside the academic world in professions relevant to the courses they teach__
Thesis, not for all faculty
Pro.

1. For some fields of study, not tangible jobs exist outside of academia.

2. Moreover, lots of professors excel in an purely academic and research-focused setting. As a physics major myself, i have met handful of stereotypical eccentric physics professor  back in college. Eg. Dr.Walter. An **austere** man, with a rigidly **puritanical** outlook.  he relished spending .........It is fatuous for society to dissipate ingenuity by requiring them to stay in touch with the so-called real world
Against.

For lots of other fields, it is advantageous. Eg. Engineering.


## Cognition
### 87. Any piece of information referred to as a fact should be mistrusted, since it may well be proven false in the future\n Reason:much of the information that people assume is factual actually turns out to be inaccurate
Thesis.
 Stay skeptical is not the same as being mistrustful. The former helps us to maintain a critical eye scrutinizing evidence presented before us. The latter foments a cynic attitude that is by no means advisable.
PRO

1. It's quixotic to mistrust every fact presented to us. While it is axiomatic that the so-called fact is nothing more than a well-examined piece of information, we should not ignore the fact that they are carefully canvassed by others. Often times we have to rely on others' discoveries to live our daily life or even make progress in a certain field. EG. programmer learning best practice

2.  Moreover, although appreciable amount of information that people held as were later debunked, more often information or theory that can be venerated as truth remain factual. Even at the rare cases where a well-established fact or theory has been betrayed by new evidence or data, the process how past people arrived at the conclusion still remain ponderable. This can be further elucidated by analyzing the development of quantum mechanics.
```
Dr. Planck first theorized about quantized energy block and later Einstein proposed consistently quantum hypothesis that light itself is made of individual quantum particles. Since then, quantum mechanics have blossomed to a palmy field that seem has supplanted classical mechanics to become the new "fact" , rely on which physicists understand the world.
```
a. classical mechanics still useful
b. the method people derived quantum mechanics share the same spirit as Newton

Against
Be critical .The justified attitude is to stay skeptical but deferential to the results, the so-called fact in this case before we have the evidence to doubt them. This attitude is  in the scientific community where...... Eg. Einstein

### 33/56/109/135. Educational institution should dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed
NO.
Pro
1. no one can forsee whether a student can succeed Eg. Hawkins and jordan
```
Take the instance of michael jordan. He was kicked out of his high school basketball team because his sports coach thought he is a poor performer but later on he became to be known as the brightest basketball player of the country. It may so happen that a person recognize their potential later in the stage of life and hence if demotivated in the crucial years of college , they may grow to develop low self esteem.
```
By depriving, we are depriving people's chance to fully realize their potential.
2. Moreover, the definition of success is multifarious. ........true someone might become the most preeminent
Against.
well-intentioned prevent people from imprudent decisions. Admittedly, educational organization often has more data......provide ample suggestions

### 48/92. Educators should teach facts only after their students have studied the ideas and concepts that help explain those facts.
Agree
Explain the what are facts and what are concepts and ideas behind using gravity force equation
```
F = (G*m1*m2)/R^2
```
Pro
1. First, exhorting students to study concepts and ideas behind facts before memorizing facts help students to form a longer term memory of the facts. The only reason. Eg. how i remember newton's law of gravitation

```
The orbit of a planet is an ellipse, with the Sun at one of the two foci.
A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
Johannes Kepler had formulated those three laws based on the painstaking astronomical observations carried out by Tycho Brahe, whom Kepler had once worked for as an assistant. But first Kepler had to re-interpret Brahe’s observations in terms of Nicolaus Copernicus’s cosmology, in which the Earth orbits around the Sun in the same way as the other planets. Thus, Newton was working from the astronomical observations of Brahe, as re-interpreted in light of Copernicus’s heliocentric system and summarized in the form of Kepler’s three laws.
```
Indeed,
2. By presenting concepts and ideas before teaching facts to students also cultivate students' critical thinking abilities. It is straightforward to remember some random facts but it requires critical thinking ability to be able to apply them in real world. Eg. learning new programming language. learn by rote
3. A more subtle and yet momentous benefit this pedagogic style brings is that students are much more likely to be engrossed by the hardest topic in the field. Eg. fewer PHD physics students

Admittedly, a reasonable criticism is it can be time consuming

__92.educators should base their assessment of students' learning not on students' grasp of facts but on the ability to explain the ideas trends and concepts that facts illustrate__

Agree
Explain the what are facts and what are concepts, ideas and trends this fact to illustrate
```
F = (G*m1*m2)/R^2
```
Pro
1. First, grasping of facts serve no purpose in real life. Only when people
2. Once students able to explain...., they are much more likely to obtain a long term memory about the fact.
3. A more subtle and yet momentous benefit this pedagogic style brings is that students are much more likely to be engrossed by the hardest topic in the field. Eg. fewer PHD physics students

### 34/49/76/79/118/146
__34. in any situation, progress requires discussion among people who have contrasting view points__

Thesis. In order to make meaningful and long-lasting progress, in lots of situations, discussion among people with opposing views should be encouraged. In some other cases, proceeding swiftly on a consensus previously reached and implementing an accepted solution can be more conducive to progress.

Pro - When to not require discussion
1. Discussion is not essential when a solution has already been clearly scoped out and the target goal is prudently established. Eg. how we develop software. Eg. physics experiment
2. Discussion is also not requisite for progress when the project is under tight-time constraint. Discussion is to find perfect solution but we can often settle on solution that is good enough.
Against
It is axiomatic that in lots of situations we do want to vehemently encourage communication between people with contrasting views. gain different views, different solutions.

__49/76/118. Claim: we can usually learn much more from people whose views we share than from those whose views contradict our own. Reason: Disagreement can cause stress and inhibit learning.__
Disagree
Pro.
1. We can learn different approach of solving a problem when we try to learn from people with contrasting views. While the initial disagreement can confer upon us some misgivings, with a open mind and critical attitude, we are able to expand our horizon and potentially find a new world that we are previously oblivious to. Eg. how Quantum mechanics advanced under the censure of Einstein.
2. Learn to cope with disagreement and the concomitant distress it can bring is beneficial for our learning. **
Against
A congenial community where people share similar goals and dreams are conducive.

79/146
__The best test of an argument is the argument's ability to convince someone with opposing view points Reason: only being forced to defend an idea against the doubts and contrasting views of others does one really discover the value of that idea.__
Thesis.While i agree with the contention that one can really discover the value of an idea after defending it against opposing views, the conclusion that the merit of an argument  is best validated by its ability to change the opinions of its opponents is flawed deeply flawed. Indeed whether an argument is sufficiently convincing to covert its opponents should not be the final judge of the argument's merit for two reasons -- an argument or theory can be rightfully established even when opposing views is not fully consolidated. Similarly, in cases where people are convinced by an argument, the argument might be mendacious.
Pro.
1. quantum mechanics and general relativity. describe how they defend ideas but fully convinced by the other side
2. On the other hand, some arugments are impressively cogent yet spurious
Against.
It is crucial to point out that this is not to repudiate of considering the opposing views and addressing doubts...............


### 42. Students should always question what they are taught instead of accepting it passively.
yes
Pro
1. When students reamin critical to facts presented by teachers, they gain a more complete picture about they knowledge they accrete.  ....EG. classcial mechanics   Even better, a more latent benefit
2. Questioning also invites a more interactive way of learning.
3. a more subtle benefit is it prepares students to become more innovative.
Against.
Admittedly, a reasonable concern should be raised for taking this suggestion -- ..-- to the extreme.

### 66. people who are most deeply committed to an idea or policy are also most critical of it
No.
Pro.
1. Devout disciple of an idea is often ardently adamant about the specific point of view. Thus, although they have most context about the idea and its potential drawbacks, they often fail to maintain a critical point of view to bring the idea or theory under scrutiny. This is best revealed by the field of religion
2. Another important aspect of being critical of an idea is to welcome......  Unfortunately, avid followers of an idea also tend to reject opposing views precipitously. We see ample examples in field of science.
 Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1904)  as counter example for rejecting relativity

Against
A few people are indeed gallant enough to question their own belief and bring the very idea they espouse under scrutiny.

```
Jennifer Doudna.
In 2012, Doudna and her colleagues made a new discovery that reduces the time and work needed to edit genomic DNA. Their discovery relies on a protein named Cas9 found in the CRISPR immune system that cooperates with guide RNA and works like scissors. The protein attacks its prey, the DNA of viruses, and slices it up. This system had been known but Dr.Doudna showed for the first time that they could use different RNAs to program it to cut and edit different DNAs. Many believe this is one of the most revolutionary technologies in decades.  Eradicate disease
```
With people rave about this new technology, Doudna remained critical of her own findings and stayed vocal about the potential ethical challenges this new technology might bring.
### 13/46/70/102/112. Universities should require students to take classes outside of their major.
No
Pro.
1. For students who have already found their passion, it is their prerogative to structure their own curriculum that helps them to achieve their dreams. At college level, .........EG. why a physicists need to study social science.........why a talented musician has to struggle through science requirement
2. From a practical point of view, allowing students voluntarily focus on courses pertinent to their major also obviates the need of spending 4 four years in college. This can be hugely advantageous for students financially
Against.
It is important to point out that all of this is not to repudiate the potential benefit for students to step out of their major and voluntarily take some courses out side of their field.  Undoubtedly, for myriad students, taking ......


### 143. no field of study can advance significantly unless it incorporates knowledge and experience from outside that field
No. too absolute and supercilious

Pro.
1. can result from advancement of technology. Computer Science.
  ```
  The Turing machine was first proposed by Alan Turing in 1936 and became the foundation for theories about computing and computers. The machine was a device that printed symbols on paper tape in a manner that emulated a person following a series of logical instructions. Without these fundamentals, we wouldn't have the computers we use today.
  ```
2. can result from challenging old paradigm to solve paradox know within the field.
```
Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation, the laws of conservation of energy and momentum, the laws of thermodynamics, and Maxwell's equations for electricity and magnetism were all more or less nearly complete at the end of the Nineteenth Century. They describe a universe consisting of bodies moving with clockwork predictability on a stage of absolute space and time. They were used to create the machines that launched two waves of industrial revolution — the first one powered by steam and the second one powered by electric current. They can be used to deliver spacecraft to the ends of the solar system with hyper-pinpoint accuracy. They are mathematically consistent in the sense that no one rule would ever violate another. They agree with reality to a high degree of accuracy as tested in experiment after experiment.

At the end of the Nineteenth Century, physics appeared to be at an apex. Several people are reported to have said something like this
The ultraviolet catastrophe, also called the Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe, was the prediction of late 19th century/early 20th century classical physics that an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium will emit radiation in all frequency ranges, emitting more energy as the frequency increases. By calculating the total amount of radiated energy (i.e., the sum of emissions in all frequency ranges), it can be shown that a blackbody would release an infinite amount of energy, contradicting the principles of conservation of energy and indicating that a new model for the behavior of blackbodies was needed.
```
Against

Undoubtedly, important edification in some fields do result from importing knowledge from other fields. A recent example is the advancement of deep learning.

### 30/83. Teachers' salaries should based on their students' academic performance
No
Pro.

1. In most places, united states or across the globe, Academic performance is usually measured by standardized tests. If teachers' salaries are solely hinged upon on their students academic performance, their focus of teaching will naturally converge upon getting higher grades.  Eg. China.

2. A policy that determine teachers' salary based on students' academic performance will make the already rampant problem of inequality of educational resource even worse.
3.  Even less people will be willing to become an educator

Against
Admittedly. this suggestion is well-intentioned. Increase the wage of teachers. Giving bonus to teachers who have helped their students to succeed not just in standardized tests but all aspects of academics.
### 36/72. government should not fund any scientific research whose consequences are unclear
No.


1. First, it is hard to find consensus to define what is unclear when it comes to scientific research. Is its efficacy on human edification? Is its potential application on a practical level? The measurement of "unclearness" of a research remains unclear itself. This is especially true in the field of natural science where lots of seminal discoveries are largely serendipitous.
   ```
In 1895, German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen who discovered X-rays. But, not on purpose. He was experimenting with cathode ray tubes when he noticed a strange glow in his dark lab some distance away from the tube. Now Röntgen expected a new type of radiation was responsible, and so he called them "X-rays," X for unknown. They could pass through paper, wood, and yes, even skin, so Röntgen took the first medical X-ray—of his wife's hand. Now upon seeing the image, she said "I have seen my own death!" Happy anniversary, honey.
   ```

2.Even if we settle on the most facile definition of "clear consequence" -- whether the research can produce useful result to validate its proposed theory. It is still impossible for government to forsee whether any project would render futile at its embryonic stage. Often, a failed experiment is not an ominous sign for predestined failure, but an essential step towards the imminent glory. If scientists have to wince at the initial failure since the government would stop funding, not much seminal scientific discoveries can be made. We can illustrate this point by examining the discovery of Higgs boson. The Higgs boson, sometimes referred to as the 'god particle,' much to the chagrin of scientists who prefer the official name, is a tiny particle that researchers long suspected existed.  The Higgs boson particle is cardinal to the Standard Model because it signals the existence of the Higgs field, an invisible energy field present throughout the universe that imbues other particles with mass. Back in 2000, almost two decades since the first postulation of Higgs boson, its discovery was hinged upon the construction of the Large Hadron Collider(LHC) in europe. There was heated debate.........The LHC started its first round of experiment and research soon after its construction in 2004. (European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN) failed. continue to ask money.......break through came in 2013

3. The essence of scientific research is to explore the unknown. Thus, the consequences of the most seminal and momentous researches are unavoidably unclear until the breakthrough is made.

### 23. Governments should place few, if any, restrictions on scientific research and development
No.
Pro
1. governments should discreetly regulate researches that can bring revolutionary changes. Eg. AI Eg. gene editing

2. Another field that should embrace restrictions from government is medical science. Eg. China with no restriction. vaccination

Against
Admittedly, governments should be cautious. Permissive enough to encourage audacious innovations in scientific researches.

### 24/29/52. The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones
Undoubtedly, praising positive actions is........ However, a pedagogical style that is simply ....... renders unrefined and imprudent.
Pro
First, Education is not just about developing one's talent and help him or her to excel in one field. It is also about inculcating a sense of moral responsibility. If an individual never get punished from wrong doings, he or she will unlikely grow up to be an honorable individual. The young rely on negative feedback from .... to discern rights from wrong and develop their moral baseline. Eg. Mencius, when
Second, with negative actions disregarded, individuals will not learn how to cope with criticism. Eg. Kevin fight with teacher

Against.
admittedly, the suggestion is well-intentioned to suggest parents to be clement ...............

### 108/110. Critical judgement of work in any given field has little value unless it comes from someone who is an expert
Disagree
1. With clearer and clearer division of labor in modern society, people from other fields might be the end user of the product you deliver. Although they are totally oblivious to jargons in your field, they can provide constructive feedback based on their user experience. Eg. software development.
2. This can be validated by the fact that lots of important scientific findings are made by fledgling instead of experts of a certain field. One example is Einstein's discovery of special relativity. Working in a patent office that ......


Against.
Admittedly, for certain fields where knowledge is arcane, a total layman's suggestion without any background in the field can be hardly constructive.

## Choice
### 142. Colleges and universities should specify all require courses and eliminate elective courses in in order to provide clear guidance for students Reason: college students -- like people in general -- prefer to follow directions rather than make their own decisions.
Disagree
Pro
First, Although it might be true for some people a predefined curriculum from the school is favorable due to its simplicity, majority of students do want to use their own discretion to choose what they want to study outside of their major. In fact, according to a research conducted by Princeton .......... Eg. my personal experience also confirm this description. As a result, it is injudicious to change the policy to accommodate a few outliers at the cost of the majority. Furthermore, even for .......
Second, it is quixotic for schools to implement the same schedule......too many students......... some people might quick to argue....multiple version. then students will have to suffer the same dilemma where too many choices are extant
Moreover, conforming all students to a few set of curriculums will be baleful for the diversity of the institution.

Against.
This suggestion is well-intentioned. It echos the grievances students have for the hassle once a semester registering hustle.
### 11/99. People's behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making
Disagree
Pro
1. In most cases, it is incumbent upon ourselves to act in a certain way, to determine what's best for the pertinent situation and take responsibility for our own behavior. Undoubtedly, People do not get to choose where they are born, the skin colors they are born with or even the early education they are conferred upon. However, it is up to the individual to how to react to asperities he or she would encounter in life -- to overcome the difficulties or to yield to encumbrances. It is up to the individual to choose to how to "behave" himself or herself to surmount mountains and achieve greatness. Eg. President Obama
2. A contention that people's behavior is solely determined by external forces is gratuitously cynical. if can not hold people who performed certain actions accountable, society will not function...
3. Fundamentally, the discussion whether one's behavior is hinged upon external forces is reduced to the threadbare philosophical question -- is free will real?

Admittedly, in quite a few cases, people's behavior is largely determined . Brain tumor

In conclusion, ......... The book of future might be written since the start of time. However, it is up to us to write all the chapters.s

## Idealism
### 51/71. Young people should be encouraged to pursue long-term, realistic goals rather than seek immediate fame and recognition
Pro.
1. pursuing long-term, realistic goal compared to seeking immediate fame and recognition  is much more conducive to the overall development of young people. EG. Einstein church
2. Focusing on long-term goal also helps people to prioritize immediate aims. My GRE

Against
Admittedly, immediate fame and recognition can offer its own benefit
### 60. politicians should pursue common ground and reasonable consensus rather than elusive ideals
### 19. Governments should focus on solving the immediate problems of today rather than trying to solve the anticipated problems of the future.


## Success
### 61. people should undertake risky action only after they have carefully consider consequences.
Pro.
1. Risky action is often not the best solution possible. better and less risky solution can likely be devised when start to carefully
2. Even when it's the best worst solutions, edge cases has to be taken into account . Nuclear tests

Against.
time consuming, time box it

### 53/130. if a goal is worthy, then any means taken to attain it are justifiable

## Individuality
### 59. Scientists and other researchers should focus their research on areas that are likely to benefit the greatest number of people.
disagree
Pro.

## modernization
### 2. To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities
While understanding the characteristics of any society is an exacting endeavor, through studying major cities of the targeted society, one can often gain a firm grasp of its most signal features.
Pros

1. Major cities often have the largest population. A society, though ostensibly an abstract concept, is nothing more than a collection of people. Naturally, a disquisition of a society is intrinsically a study about the people who constitute it. As a result, one can reveal the idiosyncrasies of a society by researching its most populated metropolises. EG. the changes in daily life for citizens of Shanghai is an epitome of what happened to Chinese society as a whole in the past 50 years.

2. Major cities are also centers for the economy, academics and entertainment. Naturally understanding the intellectual output from those centers is key to understanding a society.

## democracy
### 50/86/115. Government officials should rely on their own judgement rather than unquestioningly carry out the will of the people they serve
1. the will of the mass can sometimes be led astray. Slavery
```
 Southerners felt threatened by these northern “abolitionists” and claimed that the common government had no power to end slavery against the wishes of the states.  Eventually, southerners became convinced that the common government would attempt to abolish slavery nation-wide.  Eleven states left the United States in the following order and formed the Confederate States of America: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee.

1. why why five years?

```
Thesis:
The advancement of technology and the reliance on new inventions do not preclude people from critical thinking or creativity.

Draft
1. Pros
a. Advancement of technology has made our daily life much more convenient and productive. Instead of a bane for human capacity, in most cases, the intricate machinery in our daily life is a boon for our creativity. EG. Imagine it is 300 years ago -- long before the invention of modern transportation technology -- and you want to take a well-deserved break.
b. The reliance on highly efficient machinery extricated people from a plethora mundane drudgeries. As a result, we are freed from quotidian busy work and can invest more energy and time doing truly creative work. EG. Conspicuous examples can be found in the field of physics
2. Cons
a. some people do become lazy and too dependent upon modern technology.
```
