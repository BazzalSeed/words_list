1. As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of human to think for themselves will surely deteriorate
```
Thesis:
The advancement of technology and the reliance on new inventions do not preclude people from critical thinking or creativity.

Draft
1. Pros
a. Advancement of technology has made our daily life much more convenient and productive. Instead of a bane for human capacity, in most cases, the intricate machinery in our daily life is a boon for our creativity. EG. Imagine it is 300 years ago -- long before the invention of modern transportation technology -- and you want to take a well-deserved break.
b. The reliance on highly efficient machinery extricated people from a plethora mundane drudgeries. As a result, we are freed from quotidian busy work and can invest more energy and time doing truly creative work. EG. Conspicuous examples can be found in the field of physics
2. Cons
a. some people do become lazy and too dependent upon modern technology.

2. To understand the most important characteristics of a society one must study major cities

```
While understanding the characteristics of any society is an exacting endeavor, through studying major cities of the targeted society, one can often gain a firm grasp of its most signal features.
Pros
1. Major cities often have the largest population. A society, though ostensibly an abstract concept, is nothing more than a collection of people. Naturally, a disquisition of a society is intrinsically a study about the people who constitute it. As a result, one can reveal the idiosyncrasies of a society by researching its most populated metropolises. EG. the changes in daily life for citizens of Shanghai is an epitome of what happened to Chinese society as a whole in the past 50 years.
2. Major cities are also centers for the economy, academics and entertainment. Naturally understanding the intellectual output from those centers is key to understanding a society.
3.
Cons
Admittedly, it is too optimistic claim that through merely studying a given nation's metropolises can paint a full picture of the given society.

Conclusion
```
* 3.Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed

Thesis

Cons
1. it is all but impossible to judge whether one can succeed in an individual's future career merely based on his or her coursework. EG. Hawking
2. more fundamentally, the definition of success is diverse and can not -- also should not -- be defined a group of authorities. EG. Maoist China
Pros
However, this is not to say educators can not offer constructive advices for students in terms of career planning. On the contrary,
